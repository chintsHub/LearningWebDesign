        The fundamental purpose of this Transport Asset Management Plan (TAMP) is to improve Council’s long-term strategic management of its transport 
        assets in order to cater for the community’s required levels of service in the future as detailed under Section 3. The plan defines the state of 
        Council’s infrastructure assets at the close of the past financial year, the 10-year funding required to achieve Council’s adopted asset performance 
        targets and planned asset management activities over a 10-year planning period.
